# Tiktok Scripts
Scripts (usually Javascript) I've made for TikTok to make things easier or faster. I provide these as a repository for myself and for others who may wish to use them to manage their own account(s).

## Heads up! (DISCLAIMER)
I am absolutely certain there are terms and conditions and/or community guidelines imposed by TikTok when it comes to automation and third-party tools. So it goes without saying, that usage of scripts provided here may or may not impact your account and I shall not be held responsible either way.

## Scripts
### :warning: WARNING! Be mindful... :warning:
>  You should NEVER blindly copy/paste scripts. Review each script, ensure they're not doing anything nefarious either intentionally or accidentally. If it appears fine, decide if it is right for you.

- `Purpose`: This script allows you to unfollow accounts that do not follow you back.
- `Requirements`: A Computer with a Web Browser (Chrome or Firefox). This will not work on your phone.
- `Features`: Has configurable random delays to simulate human-ish activity, automatic scrolling and a configurable whitelist.
####  How to use Bulk/Automated Unfollow Non-Followers on TikTok  ###
  1. Log into TikTok on your computer using Chrome or Firefox, navigate to your profile.
  2. click `Following`, It should open a list of your accounts you are currently following. 
  3. Press F12 on your keyboard (or right-click, then click Inspect) and click `Console`. 
  4. Copy/Paste the script into the Console, make your changes and then hit ENTER.

 - It should begin executing and unfollowing accounts. Progress will be shown in the Console window as well.
 	- NOTE: You can interrupt the script at any time by closing the window or refreshing the page.
